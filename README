Rewritting of the Perl Acpi::Battery distribution 

Although this code works, it is still work in progress. It is a rewritting of the CPAN
Acpi::Battery because it uses the deprecated directory /proc/acpi/battery/ to get the 
battery information. 

Please, let me know if you have some improvements or suggestions.
