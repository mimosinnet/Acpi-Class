Inspired in Acpi::Battery, this module creates a class from the information in
the directory /sys/class. The subdirectories of /sys/class are called "classes"
(ArrayRef), in each "class" we can find "devices" (ArrayRef), and each "device"
has some "attributes" and "values" (HashRef). 

Please, let me know if you have some improvements or suggestions.
